# WBLR Airport Algorithms

## Developers: Tyler Hecht, Will Otani, Swaroop Thammineni, Rohan Gudipaty


## The WBLR Project Summary

In this project we designed multiple algorithms and visualization tools implemented on the network of world airports. Using a dataset retrieved from OpenFlights database, the airport network was constructed using all possible routes for the 10,000 airports across the world as of 2017. Furthermore, our algorithms will provide an in-depth exploration of optimal routes from sources and destinations as well as centrality of various airports. In addition, with visualization tools using cs225's PNG library, it allows for dynamic visualation of airport networks.

## File Interaction

The `readdat` functions read in data to construct a `Graph` network of airports. The algorithm classes utilize instances of `Graph` to operate on with respective traversals. The `makeimage` functions use the other algorithms and to visualize them on a map.


## Set Up
Clone the repository:
```
git clone [REPOSITORY URL]
cd [REPOSITORY NAME]
````
Create a build directory and use cmake to create a makefile:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Create and run executable:
```
make main
./main
```

Testing:
* For specifics test follow ./test with the test name
```
make test
./test
```

## How to Generate Visualization
1) Read in datasets to graph in `entry/main.cpp`
2) Use functions from `makeimage`to generate a plot of the Graph, Dijkstra, Centrality or Betweenness. 
3) Call function in `entry/main.cpp` and write to a file.
